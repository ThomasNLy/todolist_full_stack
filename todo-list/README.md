# Project purpose

This project was used as a means of exploring backend development by creating a to do list web app that will query with MongoDB as it's database to update, post and retrieve tasks. When adding task to the to do list it will communicate with the server file in order to connect to the MongoDB Atlas database and perform queries on it.
